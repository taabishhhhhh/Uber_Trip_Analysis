# Core
streamlit
pandas
numpy
joblib
scikit-learn==1.5.0

# plotting
matplotlib

# Explainability & ML libs (may be heavy)
shap
xgboost

# If you used LightGBM instead of sklearn/xgboost, include:
# lightgbm

# Other helpful libs
scipy
pillow

# Notes:
# - shap and xgboost are heavier and sometimes require compilation; if deployment fails,
#   remove shap/xgboost and re-deploy to confirm joblib installs. Then reintroduce one at a time.
